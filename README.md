# dev-store

This project is a showcase of using Vue to build a very simple online store. This project was created using vue-cli.

This little project was only meant to be viewed on desktop Chrome as that was the environment it was developed in.

# Installation

- Clone this repo
- `npm i`

# Running

There is a mock server that run on port 3000 that runs along side Vue's dev server. To run the app - open a terminal window at the project root then run `npm run server` then a console log should confirm that a server is listening to port 3000. Then in another terminal window run `npm run start` to start the Vue dev server.
